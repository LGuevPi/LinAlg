It is longer than I anticipated and the time gaps get increasingly bigger. I also measured other values (in steps of 100) but those aren't neccessary to show the trend and that's why I changed the step rate to 200 so that the test gets done quicker.

# So here's the main function and thus also time testing part where I decided to go in steps of 200 because the differences in time only get really high when it comes to high numbers and it's kind of unneccessary to test every single digit from 1 to 1000 because there is no practical difference between and 4*4 and a 5*5 matrix.

# c) So my implementation of the standard matrix multiplication follows O(n^3) because it uses a three nested loop. It was not a surprise that it took rather long, but it was still longer than I expected. I've done something similar when I was younger and I seem to have recalled a different amount of time-.
# still c) (and a bit of d)) just explaining what it means... It basically means that the complexity of the algorithm takes a run time that's proportional to the cube of the number of elements being processed.
# also still d) The NumPy method is way faster for lare matrices. Its complexity is different.
